# MATLAB
This repository has a collection of projects written in MATLAB; some related to mathematics, others more fun projects.

## Tank Game
This is an interesting attempt to create a classic tank game inside of MATLAB. This project was mostly a fun experiment, but I'm pretty pleased with the end result.
A demonstration video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXurPPqCJM)
